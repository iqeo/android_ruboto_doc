# Android Ruboto Documentation

Ruboto code examples for Android developer documentation. Presented in context while browsing Google Android developer documentation at http://developer.android.com.

## Description

This is a browser-based user-script implemented with the [GreaseMonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) FireFox add-on. Currently works with FireFox only, at this stage user-script incompatibilities prevent operation with Chrome.

## Installation

0. Start [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox).
0. Install the GreaseMonkey FireFox [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
0. Download the Android Ruboto Documentation [user-script](https://android-ruboto-doc.iqeo.net/android_ruboto_doc.user.js).
0. Firefox will ask to confirm installation, click Install.

## Updates

As this project develops it may be necessary to update the user-script. This is an automatic process, only requiring user confirmation when an update is available. The GreaseMonkey secure update protocol ensures that updates will only be installed from the original (SSL certificate authenticated) source at the project site https://android-ruboto-doc.iqeo.net.

## UnInstallation

0. Open the FireFox Add-Ons Manager (accessible from the FireFox menu).
0. Select the GreaseMonkey User Scripts tab.
0. Select and disable or remove this script.
0. Optionally uninstall the GreaseMonkey add-on from the FireFox Add-Ons Manager. 

## Usage



## Documentation Guidelines

Ideally, Ruboto code examples...

* Consist entirely of valid Ruby code, with non-code text; comments, links, etc.. in comments ```#...``` or ```=begin;=end``` blocks.
* Where possible, be directly equivalent to the corresponding Java code example to permit easy comparison of Java and Ruboto code.
* Provide the simplest solution utilizing Ruboto best-practices (yes.. that's currently a moving target).
* Where appropriate, provide relevant Ruboto coding alternatives.
* May provide links in comments to Ruboto tutorials, code, explanations, etc.. relevant to the example.
